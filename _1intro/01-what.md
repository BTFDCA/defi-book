title: What is DeFi?
layout: post

financial instruments built on top of a blockchain and using smart contracts

defi is one of the (few, many) applications of blockchains (with smart contracts)
other applications - nfts, gaming, etc

it all starts with tokens
arrival of ethereum popularized the concept of tokens
erc20s

a token represents something
maybe this something is another currency (dollars, euros, yens)
or maybe this something is a security (stocks)
or maybe this something is a basket of other somethings (index)
it depends
but once tokenization became a thing, people were quick to build the instruments

so what exactly are these instruments?
swapping (exchanges, namely dexes, and amm dex)
lending/borrowing
stablecoins
futures/perpetuals
options
indices
synthetic assets
yield/farming

some crypto-specific instruments
staking, restaking

as the lines of what is defi start getting blurred, with the miscegenation of other fields (tradfi+defi)
real-world assets
