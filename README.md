Hey, hey, hey!

- you think coinbase/binance/ftx are crypto
- overheard someone
- podcaster/youtuber
- been in crypto but just buying memecoins

- welcome to decentralized finance

- whiteboard-with-all-the-defi-protocols
- aave, uniswap, pendle, eigenlayer, compound, makerdao, gearbox, yearn, 
- etherfi, kelp, 


one of the problems with crypto is that a lot of these concepts are not academically defined
and even for those that are, we the people, have appropriated them and twisted their meaning, because that's how #culture works
so just because a "protocol" says one thing, they might mean a different thing, and you have to actually dig into it to understand wtf are they doing
